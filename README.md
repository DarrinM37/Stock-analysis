In conclusion, the advantage of refactoring the code created a faster macro run time. It helped to clean up the code and helped to produce cleaner data that can be easily read and understood by others who may be looking at the code when you are not available. The con to refractoring is time, one may not have the time or there is to much data involved for refactoring to be do-able.
